Our website is a job portal we had created a job portal site which displays the upcoming jobs in the market where people can apply through our website, since being in the initial stages, we hadn't had hosted this on any server we created a local host and then made the website. 

Since the task was a full stack web development we did both the HTMl and CSS on the website and then deployed it in the local host.
